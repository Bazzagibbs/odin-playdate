# Build scripts for Playdate apps written in Odin

Copy these build scripts to your project's root directory.

Change the game name at the top of each batch file if desired (default: "game")

- `build_sim.bat`: build the game for the Playdate Simulator
- `build_run_sim.bat`: build the game for the Playdate Simulator, then run it.
- `build_device.bat`: build the game for the physical Playdate device.

If a script is called with arguments, they will be passed to the `odin build` command.
