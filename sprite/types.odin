// - `sprite`: The sprite being moved.
// - `other`: The sprite colliding with the sprite being moved.
// - `response_type`: The result of collisionResponse.
// - `overlaps`: True if the sprite was overlapping other when the collision started. False if it didnâ€™t overlap but tunneled through other.
// - `ti`: A number between 0 and 1 indicating how far along the movement to the goal the collision occurred.
// - `move`: The difference between the original coordinates and the actual ones when the collision happened.
// - `normal`: The collision normal; usually -1, 0, or 1 in x and y. Use this value to determine things like if your character is touching the ground.
// - `touch`: The coordinates where the sprite started touching other.
// - `sprite_rect`: The rectangle the sprite occupied when the touch happened.
// - `other_rect`: The rectangle the sprite being collided with occupied when the touch happened.
